# Headless Add to Cart Example
This project demonstrates how to integrate Rise.ai's gift card functionality into a headless Shopify store using plain JavaScript.

## Overview
In this example, we show how to build a custom product page for a headless Shopify store that incorporates Rise.aiâ€™s gift card functionality. 
The product page is constructed using basic HTML and includes the necessary Rise.ai integration.

The example also illustrates how to:

- Add the Rise-add-to-cart-button class to the "Add to Cart" button.
- Configure the Rise object to handle the gift card logic.
By following these steps, users can seamlessly add gift cards to their cart.

## Relevant files
### [index.html](./index.html)
Contains the basic HTML structure for the gift card product page. It includes the necessary Rise.ai script and the "Add to Cart" button.

### [script.js](./script.js)
Contains the JavaScript logic for configuring the Rise object and managing the "Add to Cart" functionality. The addToCart function is used to add the gift card to the cart.

## Running the Page
This example includes a static HTML file. To run it:
- Open the static html `index.html` file at your browser.
- You can then interact with the "Add to Cart" button and test the functionality.
